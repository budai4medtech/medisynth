## Title:
Good practices in AI/ML for Medical Image Synthesis

## Keywords:
Image synthesis


## Abstract:
Medical Image Synthesis has been making great progress since the publication of generative models and the most recent diffusion models.
In this talk, I will provide background on applications for medical image synthesis e.g. classification, augmentation, segmentration, registration and other downstreams tasks, etc.
Similarly, I will overview the balance between GANS, VANs and Diffusion models and cover implemenation workflows following good practices and FDA guidelines, aiming to provide understanding of essentials to train reliable, repeatable, reproducible and validted models for medical image synthesis.
Particularly, I will discuss an ML workflow for fetal brain ultrasound image sysntehsis, and its quality image assemsment (visual turing test and FID scores).
Finally, I will present a quick prototype in github, google-colabs and guidelines to train it using myriam server.

## Short-bio
Miguel is a Research Engineer at University College London within the Advanced Research Computing Centre and WEISS where he is advancing AI-based Surgical Navigation tools. Previously, he was a Research Associate at King’s College London where he advanced research in Ultrasound-Guidance Procedures and AI-enabled echocardiography pipelines. In 2019, he was awarded a Ph.D. degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Birmingham, researching “Nonlinear Analysis to Quantify Movement Variability in Human-Humanoid Interaction”. His primary research interests are in developing data-centric AI algorithms for Medical Imaging, MedTech, SurgTech, Biomechanics and clinical translation. Additionally, his work includes generative models for fetal imaging, sensor fusion data from time-series and medical imaging, real-time AI for echocardiography, image-guided procedures, AI-based surgical navigation tools, and child-robot interaction in low-resource countries.
