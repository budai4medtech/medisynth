Safeguards for Effective
In considering the widespread adoption of AI algorithms in radiology, a critical question arises: Will they work for all patients? The models underlying specific AI applications are often not tested outside the setting in which they were trained, and even AI systems that receive FDA approval are rarely tested prospectively or in multiple clinical settings.38 Very few randomized, controlled trials have shown the safety and effectiveness of existing AI algorithms in radiology, and the lack of real-world evaluation of AI systems can pose a substantial risk to patients and clinicians.39

There is a pressing need for the development of methods that improve the generalization of algorithms in new settings.49-51 As the field matures, better generalization checks based on accepted standards must be established before the algorithms are widely applied. These checks encompass three related areas: clinicianâ€“AI collaboration, transparency, and monitoring (Figure 2).

Transparency
Transparency is a major challenge in evaluating
the generalization behavior of AI algorithms in 
medical imaging. Scientific, peer-reviewed evidence of efficacy is lacking for most commercially available AI products.38 Many published
reports on FDA-cleared devices omit information on sample size, demographic characteristics
of patients, and specifications of the equipment
used to acquire the images to be interpreted. In
addition, only a fraction of device studies offer
data on the specific demographic subgroups
used during algorithm training, as well as the
diagnostic performance of these algorithms
when applied to patients from underrepresented
demographic subgroups. This lack of information makes it difficult to determine the generalizability of AI and machine-learning algorithms
across different patient populations.

Postdeployment Monitoring

Continuous monitoring of model performance
and proactive measures to address data set shifts
over time can improve the accuracy and reliability of AI models in medical-imaging interpretation. Regular updates of the training data and
retraining of the model on new data through
continual learning can help maintain model performance over time.78 In addition, incorporating
feedback from clinicians can help improve the
performance of the model by providing realworld insights and identifying areas for improvement. Ultimately, postdeployment monitoring is essential to ensure that AI models remain
effective and reliable in clinical settings.79,80
